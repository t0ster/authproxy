#+TITLE: AuthProxy

Simple reverse proxy which stores jwt token in encrypted cookie and adds `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` header to requests to the upstream server.

** Features
- Cloud (Docker / Kubernetes) friendly
- Helm chart included (TODO)

* Reason
- Reusable component for the micro-services architecture
- More safe way to store jwt token
  In encrypted cookie instead of browser local storage
- Possibility to discard session

This POC is inspired by https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper

* How it Works

* Requirements
- Web app must be on the same root domain as authproxy

* Usage
** Configuration
TODO
